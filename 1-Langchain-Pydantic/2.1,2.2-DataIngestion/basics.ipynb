       "AIMessage(content=\"\\n<think>\\nOkay, I need to figure out what the capital of France is. Let's start by recalling what I know about France. France is a country in Western Europe, right? I remember learning about some of its cities like Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and maybe Nice. I think Paris is a major city there. Wait, isn't Paris the capital? Hmm, but I should make sure I'm not confusing it with another country's capital. Let me think... Spain's capital is Madrid, Italy's is Rome, so France must have a different one. I've heard the Eiffel Tower is in Paris, which is in France. That's a landmark, so maybe that's in the capital. But wait, sometimes big cities aren't the capital. Like in the US, New York is big but the capital is Washington D.C. But in France's case, I think Paris is both the largest city and the capital. Let me try to remember any historical context. The French government is there, right? The President's palace, maybe the Élysée Palace? That's in Paris. Also, when I see news about the French government, it's always referred to as being in Paris. So putting this all together, I'm pretty sure the capital of France is Paris. But maybe I should double-check in case there's some recent change or if I'm mixing up information. Wait, no, I don't recall any changes to France's capital. Yeah, I think that's solid.

Maybe check if there was a historical change? Like, during some events, but no, even during wartime, Paris remained the capital. Also, in terms of cultural significance, Paris is the heart of France. So the answer should be Paris. I don't see any reason to doubt that. Just to be thorough, maybe think about other possibilities. Lyon? No, that's a major city but not the capital. Marseille?

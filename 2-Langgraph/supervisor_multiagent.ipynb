      "Okay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, I think I've heard this before, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to remember. I know that France is a country in Europe, and I believe its capital is a pretty famous city. Maybe Paris? That sounds familiar. I've heard of the Eiffel Tower, which is in Paris, right? So, if Paris is the capital, that makes sense because a lot of countries have their capitals associated with well-known landmarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but I'm not 100% certain. Could there be another city that's the capital? I don't think so. I remember learning that London is the capital of England, Berlin is the capital of Germany, and Paris for France. Yeah, that seems to line up. I don't think it's Lyon or Marseille because those are other cities in France but not the capital.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess another way to confirm would be to think about government buildings. The capital usually has the main government offices and the president's residence. I think the French president lives in Paris, so that must be the capital. Also, when I think of French culture, Paris is the center for fashion, art, and cuisine, which are often centered in the capital city.\n",
      "\n",
